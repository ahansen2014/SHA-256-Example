# SHA-256-Example
A demonstration of the SHA-256 algorithm with data stored as binary strings.

This work is inspired by Lane Wagner and his website "How SHA-256 works step-by-step" (https://qvault.io/cryptography/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/).
Personally, I found this explanation very clear and concise.  The working in the steps is thorough and well documented.  After reading it I wanted to see if
I could code it myself.  And I did.

It goes without saying that this code is for demonstration purposes only and not meant for production.
Enjoy.
